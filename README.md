Running our code requires a little bit of server work.

To run the chat server:
Jocelyn please put instructions here lol

To run the node.js server:
1. Navigate to the folder with our code in it using your terminal.
2. Type "http-server" into the command line (without quotes). If you do not have node installed, follow the instructions found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
3. Copy-paste one of the available servers into your browser and add "/home.html" to open our home page. You can then use our application like a normal website.
