\f0\fs24 \cf0 The project I\'92m working on is a virtual office hours chat where instructors and students can chat in real time about their classes and instructors can offer as much real time support as they can for students. I\'92ve done the backend part where two people can communicate with each other if they open the same page (as shown in the video). I also have buttons and other functionalities that I\'92ve shown in the demo too.\

To run the code, you simply just download the zipped code and put the folder on your desktop. Then, open up the home.html page on chrome (preferably), and you can start interacting with the interface!}
